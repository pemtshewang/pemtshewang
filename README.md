<h3 align="center">My Projects</h3>
1. **[Samchar](https://samchar.vercel.app)**
> A Full Stack NextJS application built as a Grievances System for CST. Featuring upvotes for the posted grievances, and the system provides analytics for the posted grievances.

   - Works as RBACs, and emails are entertained for only a specific domain (.cst.edu.bt)
   - Anonymity at the frontend
   - Featuring NextAuth for authentication
   - UI library - It's all shadcn with lucide-icons
   - Future works - `making it mobile responsive`
   
2. **[Bhutanese Shamu](https://bhutanese-shamu.vercel.app)**
> Bhutanese-shamu is a Bhutanese mushroom detection website. We built our custom dataset trained googlenet model with good accuracy while training and testing. The project was carried out as a mini project in artificial intelligence module while at 4th year 1st sem. The dataset consists of approximately 8000 images of all mushrooms with 800 images in each class(10). The backend is built with Django and a headless frontend system is built with NextJS 14.

   - Backend: https://pythonanywhere.com
   - Frontend: https://vercel.app
   - Dataset: collected from google sources  
   - Features
      - Detects the given mushroom
      - Maps the detected mushroom to their Dzongkha names
      - Provides a short description of the detected mushroom

<h3 align="center">ðŸŒˆ Gratitude Extravaganza</h3>

- In the grand tapestry of code, I find myself weaving alongside extraordinary mentors and teammatesâ€”architects of the imagination, alchemists of dreams. Together, we've embarked on a transformative odyssey, molding mere ideas into the palpable reality of code.

- ðŸš€ A cosmic shout-out to these guiding stars, my mentors and teammates, for not just being part of the journey but becoming the journey itself. With their cosmic wisdom and collaborative spirit, we've conjured digital wonders that defy the ordinary.

- ðŸŒŸ But wait, the cosmic symphony doesn't end there! Enter the celestial benefactors, the free hosting wizardsâ€”Vercel, PythonAnywhere, and their kin. In their benevolence, they've opened portals to the digital realm, offering free sanctuaries where imaginations roam free and dreams take flight.

- ðŸŒŒ Together, we're not just coding; we're orchestrating a cosmic ballet of innovation, and for that, my deepest appreciation resonates across the digital cosmos.
